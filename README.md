# GifTasTic

## Overview
This fun, dynamic web page was created to populate with gifs of user's choice. While an animal theme and a set of pre-populated animals were chosen, the app gives users flexibility to either add other animals to the list or choose a different topic. 

* When the user clicks on a button, the page will display 10 static, non-animated gif images from GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks on one of the images, the gif will animate.  To stop the animation, user clicks the image again.

* Every image will have its rating displayed.
